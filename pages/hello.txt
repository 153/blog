Hello world!

I've decided to restart the 4x13.net blog after a break of approximately ten
years, inspired largely by the blog of my friend [Akaines](//akai.gikopoi.com).

A number of things I hope to write about:

* music reviews, contemporary and vintage
* various projects and hobbies that interest me
* discussion about books
* looks into Indonesian life as a migrant
* reflections and accomplishments

Hang tight until the blog is finished developing. Things will be a little bumpy.
There will be an atom feed, so feel free to subscribe once it goes online.
Source code and all content will be released into the public domain.
